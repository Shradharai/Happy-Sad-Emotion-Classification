A **Happy-Sad Emotion Classifier** is a machine learning model designed to classify emotions as either "Happy" or "Sad" based on text, speech, or images. For text, NLP techniques like sentiment analysis with LSTMs or transformers (BERT) are used, while speech-based classification relies on audio features like MFCCs and deep learning models such as CNNs and LSTMs. Image-based classification leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on facial expression datasets like FER-2013. The model undergoes preprocessing, training, and evaluation before being deployed using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI for real-world applications such as sentiment analysis in chatbots, mental health monitoring, and human-computer interaction.
